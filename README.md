# JavaScript Framework

A JavaScript framework with a utility and DOM library and MVC structure. This framework is designed to be well documented but also religiously follow the recommendations and practices of [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com) (mainly to see if it can be done).

This library prioritises readability and code style over performance. As such, although I will maintain this library as best I can, you may have better luck with other libraries if you want similar features:

- For utility functions, [lodash](https://lodash.com) is very performance-driven.
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com) is one of the best DOM libraries available.
- A lot of the MVC structure of this library is based on [canjs](https://canjs.com)

## State of this library

Currently this library is an unfinished draft or in a pre-alpha state.
